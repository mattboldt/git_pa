# Guac

Guac is a command line program to manage multiple local git repos with one command. Guac stands for `git update cli`, but it's also just a very easy to type command. Furthermore, it's shorthand for Guacamole, e.g.: "Holy Guacamole, this gem makes updating all my repos very fast and easy".

Guac is written in Ruby, so you'll need to have that installed on your machine, but the functionality itself is language agnostic.

## Installation

    $ gem install guac

## Usage

```bash
# Run setup
guac config

# Show all statuses
guac status

# Update all on master
guac up master
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
